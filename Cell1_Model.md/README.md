[Cell1_Model.md](Cell1_Model.md) contains files that both simulate the change in a cell's gene expression over time and model the cell's dynamics
using a neural network.

[Cell1_TimeSeries_Simulation.jl](Cell1_Model.md/Cell1_TimeSeries_Simulation.jl) uses the system of differential equations from [Maclean and Franke]()to model the change in gene expression of
a blood cell over time.
