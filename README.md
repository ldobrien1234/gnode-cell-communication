# gnode-cell-communication
In this repository, I created a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (GNODE) to
model cell communication.

The file Topology_Trajectories.jl was modified slightly from Franke and MacLean (https://github.com/maclean-lab/Cell-Cell-Communication).
I used their model to simulate training data for the GNODE. The
