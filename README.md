# gnode-cell-communication
In this repository, I created a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (GNODE) to
model cell communication.

The file Topology_Trajectories.jl was modified slightly from Franke and MacLean (https://github.com/maclean-lab/Cell-Cell-Communication).
I used their model to simulate training data for the GNODE. cell_data_2000.txt contains a sample of training data
generated by their model. The first row in the text file contains inputs, while the second contains outputs. Each input
and output is a 3 x 4 feature matrix, where each row represents a cell type, and the columns represent the gene expression
levels of GATA1, PU.1, an additional regulatory gene, and some parameter A0. We only use the first three columns when training
the GNODE.

cell_neuralnet.py uses a GNODE to learn the final state of the cells given the initial states and a graph representing which
cells communicate. In real observational data, we could infer graph structure based on ligand-receptor pairs between cell types.
After training the GNODE, the file computes the Jacobian of the dynamics with respect to the input at the final time. This lets us
infer which cell types are influencing development most. The neural network can easily be modified to incorporate time-series data
at multiple time-points. In fact, with more time-points, the network would probably be better at learning the cell dynamics
and causal relationships between cell types.
